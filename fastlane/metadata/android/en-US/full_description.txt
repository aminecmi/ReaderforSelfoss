A new RSS reader for <a href="http://selfoss.aditu.de/">selfoss</a>.

What it does:

<ul>
  <li>Fetches read, unread, and favorite feeds.</li>
  <li>Marking as read, marking as favorite.</li>
  <li>Manage selfoss sources from the app.</li>
  <li>Add an RSS feed from within the app, or by sharing a link from your browser.</li>
